## Title:
Building asynchronous microservices using Springboot and Apache Kafka.

## Overview:

This project demonstrates how to build microservices using Spring Boot and enable asynchronous communication between them using Apache Kafka as a message broker. It showcases end-to-end event-driven communication through Dockerized services, running seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces.

## Technologies Used:

1. Spring Boot -  Framework for building Java microservices
2. Apache Kafka  - Message broker for asynchronous,event-driven communication
3. GitHub codespaces - Cloud-based development environment
4. Maven -Build and dependency management tool
5. Docker -For containerizing the producer and consumer microservices
